    <h1>Welcome to my responsive webpage</h1>

    <p> Sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum ears back wide eyed why use post when this sofa is here for grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) for friends are not food. Hack eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender yet lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody for hack up furballs steal the warm chair right after you get up and attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim. Catto munch salmono paw your face to wake you up in the morning.  </p>
